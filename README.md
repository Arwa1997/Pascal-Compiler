# Pascal-Compiler

Notes:
 - Pascal programs that run in the program are included with a .pas extension.
 - To run each one of them change the filename in the filereader from the Parser class to the name of the desired file.  
 - The generated code appears in the "codewrite.txt" file.  
 
 Additional features: 
 
    - For loop code gets parsed correctly.
    - Object code is written but it has minor errors, to run the assembler uncomment the assembler part in the main "Compiler.java".
